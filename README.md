# Image Classification with Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project implements an image classification system using Transfer Learning to predict and categorize images uploaded by users. The model leverages pre-trained neural networks, fine-tuned for our specific task, and is deployed in a Go backend for efficient inference.

## Data Structure
### Dataset Organization
- **Training Set**: Labeled images organized into class-specific folders
- **Validation Set**: 20% of training data held out for model evaluation
- **Test Set**: Completely separate dataset for final model evaluation
- **Image Format**: RGB images standardized to dimensions required by the base model (typically 224×224 pixels)

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Resizing images to match base model input requirements
2. Normalization according to pre-trained model specifications:
   - For VGG/ResNet: RGB channel-wise mean subtraction
   - For EfficientNet/MobileNet: Normalization to [-1, 1] range
3. Data augmentation techniques:
   - Random crops and rotations
   - Color jittering
   - Mixup augmentation (creating weighted combinations of images)

## Transfer Learning Approach
### Base Model Selection
The project uses a pre-trained **EfficientNetB3** model, originally trained on ImageNet, as the feature extractor. This model offers an excellent balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Training Methodology
- **Training Strategy**: Two-phase approach
  1. Feature extraction (base model frozen)
  2. Fine-tuning (gradual unfreezing of top layers)
- **Optimizer**: 
  - Phase 1: Adam (lr=0.001)
  - Phase 2: SGD with momentum (lr=0.0001)
- **Learning Rate Schedule**: Cosine decay with restarts
- **Batch Size**: 16 for fine-tuning
- **Epochs**: 
  - Phase 1: 10 epochs
  - Phase 2: 30 epochs with early stopping

## Integration with Go Backend
The model is integrated into the Go backend using either:

1. **TensorFlow Serving**:
   - Model deployed as a RESTful service
   - Go backend communicates with it via HTTP requests

2. **Direct Integration**:
   - TensorFlow Go bindings load the saved model
   - Pre/post-processing handled within the Go application

## Scientific Methodologies
### Transfer Learning Principles
- Leveraging low and mid-level features from pre-trained models
- Domain adaptation through fine-tuning
- Feature representation analysis through t-SNE visualization

### Hyperparameter Optimization
- Bayesian optimization for learning rate and regularization parameters
- Progressive layer unfreezing schedule optimization
- Exploration of various pooling strategies

### Evaluation Framework
- Stratified k-fold validation
- Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics
- Precision-Recall curves for class imbalance analysis
- Grad-CAM visualization for model decisions explanation

## Future Improvements (Without Limitations)
1. **Advanced Model Architectures**:
   - Vision Transformer (ViT) implementation
   - Neural Architecture Search for custom model design
   - Multi-modal fusion (combining image with metadata)

2. **Ensemble Approaches**:
   - Bagging/boosting of multiple transfer learning models
   - Model stacking with different pre-trained backbones
   - Snapshot ensembling during training

3. **Robustness Enhancements**:
   - Adversarial training for improved generalization
   - Test-time augmentation for more reliable predictions
   - Self-supervised pre-training on domain-specific data

4. **Deployment Optimizations**:
   - Model distillation to create smaller, faster models
   - ONNX conversion for cross-platform compatibility
   - Edge deployment optimization (TensorFlow Lite)

## Requirements
- TensorFlow 2.4+
- Go 1.16+
- Either TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Go bindings
